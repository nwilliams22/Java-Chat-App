# Java-Chat-App
A (hopefully) neat little chat app made in Java. Discord better watch out now...


This is built as a group chat rather than direct message. Hoping to either add that functionality or make a new one with both.

Should be known already, but just in case, to have it work properly you'll need to run the server first and then the client.
